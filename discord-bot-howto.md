+ Log into your Discord account. Add a server where you want to have the bot.

+ Now, in Discord, go to Settings, click on "Advanced" to the left. Enable "Developer Mode", and click on the link "Discord API" in the paragraph following the developer mode headline.

+ Click on "Applications" to the left, then on "New Application" to the right. Give the bot the name you want it to have on your server, and then click "Create."

+ Now click on "Bot" to the left, then "Reset Token". Copy the resulting token string and paste it someplace where you can retrieve it (it will go in a token.txt file in whitebot). Scroll down and enable "Message Content Intent."

+ Click on "OAuth2," then "Url Generator." Select "bot" among the scopes, then "Send messages" among the text permissions. Copy the generated url at the bottom.

+ Paste the copied url into your browser, select your server, press "Continue," then "Authorize." Confirm that you are human.

+ Done for the discord part.
